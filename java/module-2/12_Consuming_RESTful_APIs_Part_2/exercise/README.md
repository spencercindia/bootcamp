# Consuming APIs: POST, PUT, and DELETE (Java)

In this exercise, you'll work on a command-line application that displays online auction info. Most of the command-line application is provided. You'll add more code that calls the API.

Your task is to add web API calls using `RestTemplate` to create new auctions (`POST`), update existing auctions (`PUT`) and delete (`DELETE`) auctions.

## Step One: Start the server

Before starting, make sure the web API is up and running. Open the command line and navigate to the `./server/` folder in this exercise.

First, run the command `npm install` to install any dependencies. You won't need to do this on any subsequent run.

To start the server, run the command `npm start`. If there aren't any errors, you'll see the following, which means that you've successfully set up your web API:

```
  \{^_^}/ hi!

  Loading data-generation.js
  Done

  Resources
  http://localhost:3000/auctions

  Home
  http://localhost:3000

  Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database
```

You can stop the server, or any other process that you've started from the console, by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C`.

In this exercise, you'll modify data on the server. As you're working, you may come across a situation where you want to reset the data. To do this, first stop the server with `Ctrl+C`, then restart it with `npm start`.

## Step Two: Explore the API

Before moving on to the next step, explore the web API using Postman. You can access the following endpoints:

- GET: http://localhost:3000/auctions
- GET: http://localhost:3000/auctions/{id} (use a number between 1 and 7 in place of {id})

These are the endpoints you'll work on for this exercise:

- POST: http://localhost:3000/auctions
- PUT: http://localhost:3000/auctions/{id}
- DELETE: http://localhost:3000/auctions/{id}

## Step Three: Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* All unit tests pass in `AuctionServiceTest.java`.
* Code is clean, concise, and readable.

To complete this exercise, you need to complete the `AuctionService` class by implementing the `add()`, `update()`, and `delete()` methods.

### Tips and tricks

* There are two helper methods you will need to write:
        One that makes an `Auction` object given a csv string containing four elements.
        One that creates an `HttpEntity` with a content-type header set to JSON.
* The `add()` method takes an `Auction` object as a parameter that's passed from the console. The `add()` method must return the `Auction` object that comes back from the API.
* The `update()` method takes an `Auction` object as a parameter that's passed from the console. The `update()` method must return `true` if no errors occur when calling the API, and `false` otherwise.
* The `delete()` method takes an integer as a parameter that's passed from the console. It's the ID of the auction to delete. The `delete()` method must return `true` if no errors occur when calling the API, and `false` otherwise.
* When writing all three methods, consider that an error may occur when calling the API.

## Step Four: Write the helper methods makeAuction and makeEntity
The makeAuction method (in ConsoleService.java) must create a new auction from a CSV string. The CSV string should contain four elements.

```java
public Auction makeAuction(String csv) {
    // place code here
    return null;
}
```
The makeEntity method creates an HttpEntity object with a content-type header of JSON. 

```java
private HttpEntity<Auction> makeEntity(Auction auction)
    // place code here
    return null;
}
```

## Step Five: Add a new auction

The `add()` method sends the `newAuction` parameter to the API. You can use the helper method mentioned earlier to make a new `HttpEntity`. Make sure to handle any exceptions that might be thrown:

```java
public Auction add(Auction newAuction) {
    // place code here
    return null;
}
```

When you've completed the `add()` method, run the unit tests, and verify that the three tests that begin with `add_` all pass.

## Step Six: Update an existing auction

The `update()` method sends the `updatedAuction` parameter to the API to replace the existing one. You can use the helper method mentioned earlier to make a new `HttpEntity`. Make sure to handle any exceptions that might be thrown:

```java
public boolean update(Auction updatedAuction) {
    // place code here
    return false;
}
```

When you've completed the `update()` method, run the unit tests, and verify that the three tests that begin with `update_` all pass.

## Step Seven: Delete an auction

The `delete()` method removes the auction from the system with the ID that matches the `auctionId` parameter. Make sure to handle any exceptions that might come up. What happens if you enter an ID for an auction that doesn't exist?

```java
public boolean delete(int auctionId) {
    // place code here
    return false;
}
```

When you've completed the `delete()` method, run the unit tests, and verify that the three tests that begin with `delete_` all pass.

Once all unit tests pass, you've completed this exercise.

# Challenge
(this portion of the exercise is not graded but will help prepare you for the mini-capstone next week)

## Challenge 1: Create Auction (easy)
The current user experience for creating an auction is not ideal. You should improve this experience

Instead of requiring the user to insert a comma separated string to create a new auction, you should prompt the user separately for each part.

```
Auction Title:
Description:
Current High Bidder:
Current Bid:
```

## Challenge 2: Display Bids (medium)
In addition to a list of auctions and high bids, the Auction API also includes a list of bids for each auction.

You will need to create a `Bid` model that includes the following properties. Be sure to add getters and setters for all of these.
```java
int id;
int auctionId;
String user;
double bid;
```

Modify the `AuctionService` to allow users to get a list of bids for an auction.

Add this function and complete the logic.
```java
public Bid[] getBids(int auctionId)
{
    Bid[] bids = null;
    
    // your logic goes here
        
    return bids;
}
```

## Challenge 3: Add Bid (difficult)
In this challenge you will need to add an option to the user interface to allow the user to add a bid to an auction.

### Step 1: Create the User Interface
1. Add the menu option to bid on an auction
2. Prompt the user for the Auction ID that they are bidding on
3. Prompt the user for their username
4. Prompt the user for the bid

### Step 2: Add the Create Bid logic to the `AuctionService`
Add a method to the AuctionService that creates a new Bid in the API

```java
public Bid addBid(Bid newBid)
{
    // your code goes here
    return null;    
}
```

### Step 3: Update the Auction with the new Bid
Once the bid has been created add logic to update the auction that received the new bid, so that it reflects the new high bid and username.
